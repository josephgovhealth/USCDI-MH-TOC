<div class="profile-description">
<p>The US Core MedicationRequest Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medicationrequest.html">MedicationRequest</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile meets the requirements of the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/isp/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi">U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)</a>  <em>Medications</em> Data Class. This profile sets minimum expectations for the MedicationRequest resource to record, search, and fetch a patient's medication prescriptions or orders. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
