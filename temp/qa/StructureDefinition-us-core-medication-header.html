<div class="profile-description">
<p>The US Core Medication Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medication.html">Medication</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the Medication resource to record, search, and fetch medications associated with a patient. When referencing a medication, the MedicationRequest resource can use a code or refer to this profile. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
