<div class="profile-description">
<p>The US Core Coverage Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/coverage.html">Coverage</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile meets the requirements of the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) <em>Health Insurance Information</em> Data Class. It sets minimum expectations for the Coverage resource to record, search, and fetch data related to an individual's insurance coverage for health care. It specifies which core elements, extensions,  vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
