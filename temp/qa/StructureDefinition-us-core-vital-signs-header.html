It specifies which core elements, extensions,  vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.  This US Core profiles that are derived from this profile  are listed below.</p>
