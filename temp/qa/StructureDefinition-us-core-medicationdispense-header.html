<div class="profile-description">
<p>The US Core MedicationDispense Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/medicationdispense.html">MedicationDispense</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the MedicationDispense resource to record, search, and fetch the state of a patients medication with regards to dispensing or other activity. (e.g., dispensed, partially dispensed, not dispensed)  It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
