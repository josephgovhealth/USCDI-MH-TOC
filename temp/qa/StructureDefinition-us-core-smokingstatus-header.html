<div class="profile-description">
<p>The US Core Smoking Status Observation Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html">Observation</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile meets the requirements of the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)  <em>Smoking Status</em> Data Element. This profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search, and fetch smoking status data associated with a patient. It specifies which core elements, extensions,  vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
