<div class="profile-description">
<p>The US Core ServiceRequest Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for recording, searching, and fetching the ServiceRequest information. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
