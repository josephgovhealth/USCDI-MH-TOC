This Profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search, and fetch sexual orientation observations associated with a patient. It specifies which core elements, extensions,  vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
