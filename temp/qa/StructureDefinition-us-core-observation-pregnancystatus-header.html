<div class="profile-description">
<p>The  US Core Pregnancy Status Observation Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html">Observation</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile meets the requirements of the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)  <em>Pregnancy Status</em> Data Element. It sets minimum expectations for the  Observation resource to record, search, and fetch the patient's state or condition of being pregnant. It specifies which core elements, extensions,  vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
