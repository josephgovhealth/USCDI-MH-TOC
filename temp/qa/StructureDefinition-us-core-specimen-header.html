<div class="profile-description">
<p>The US Core Specimen Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/specimen.html">Specimen</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the Specimen resource to record, search, and fetch information about substances associated with a patient being sampled or tested (such as nasopharyngeal swab, whole blood,  or serum). It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
