<div class="profile-description">
<p>The US Core CareTeam Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/careteam.html">CareTeam</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the CareTeam resource for identifying the Care Team members associated with a patient to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource and how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
