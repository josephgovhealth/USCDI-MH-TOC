<div class="profile-description">
<p>The US Core Device Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/device.html">Device</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile meets the requirements of the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) <em>Unique Device  Identifier - Implantable</em> Data Element. It sets minimum expectations for the Device resource to record, search, and fetch UDI information associated with a patient's implantable device(s). It specifies which core elements, extensions,  vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
