 <tr><td>Definition:</td><td><p>The US Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile inherits from the FHIR <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition.html">Condition</a> resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. US Core version 5.0.0 split the US Core Condition Profile into this profile and the US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile. This profile meets the requirements of the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)  <em>Problems</em>, <em>Health Concerns</em>, and <em>SDOH Problems/Health Concerns</em> Data Elements. It sets minimum expectations for the Condition resource to record, search, and fetch information about a condition, diagnosis, or another event, situation, issue, or clinical concept documented and categorized as a problem or health concern, including information about a Social Determinants of Health related condition. It specifies which core elements, extensions,  vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
