This profile sets minimum expectations for the Location resource for  recording, searching, and fetching a &quot;physical place of available services or resources.&quot;  It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets <strong>SHALL</strong> be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.</p>
